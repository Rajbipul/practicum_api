# IoT-Vending-Machine

**A 3rd Year Group Project from IIT Patna**

This project integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) with a web-site to enable users to order products from a vending machine remotely. Unlike conventional coin-based vending machines, this system utilizes online payment methods for a seamless and secure user experience.

**Features:**

1. **Product Ordering:**
    * Users can browse available products on the website.
    * **Select quantity:** Users can choose the desired quantity for each product.
2. **Inventory Management:** Real-time inventory tracking with automatic updates upon product dispensing.
3. **Payment Integration:** Secure online payments through Razorpay.
4. **[In Progress] WhatsApp Bill Message:** Automated WhatsApp messages with order details and payment confirmations.
5. **IoT Integration:** 
    * Microcontroller-based control of vending machine mechanisms (e.g., product selection, quantity dispensing, dispensing).
    * Communication between the microcontroller and the web server using an appropriate IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT, CoAP).

**Usage:**

1. Visit the project website.
2. Browse the available products.
3. Select quantity: Choose the desired quantity for each product.
4. Add selected products to the cart.
5. Proceed to checkout and make payment using Razorpay.
6. Upon successful payment, the order will be processed, and the vending machine will dispense the selected products in the specified quantities.
7. [In Progress] Receive an order confirmation and payment summary via WhatsApp message.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Rajbipul/Engineering-Practicum.git
2. **Configure:**
   Razorpay: Obtain and integrate your Razorpay credentials.
   WhatsApp API: [If applicable] Obtain and integrate WhatsApp API credentials.
   * **Microcontroller Configuration:**
     Configure the microcontroller with the necessary network settings and pin assignments.
     Quantity Control: Implement logic in the microcontroller to handle quantity dispensing requests.
3. **Run the Project**
